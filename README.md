# Watchtide: A Home SOC Built on Wazuh, SQL Server and Power BI

Watchtide is a working security operations lab: a Windows endpoint instrumented with Sysmon, monitored by a self-hosted Wazuh SIEM, with alerts loaded into a SQL Server warehouse and reported in Power BI. It was built, broken, fixed, hardened and tuned by hand, and every step is documented.

**Author:** Jordan Carven-Bellace

*Formerly named SentinelGrid. Some internal identifiers (the `SentinelGridWarehouse` database, the `SentinelGrid-Wazuh` VM, scheduled task and rule-file names) keep the original name so the running system did not need to change.*

**[Open the Watchtide console](https://jordan17133.github.io/Watchtide/)**: a read-only SOC console built on a scrubbed snapshot of this lab's real alerts, cases and ATT&CK coverage. It runs in the browser, with no setup and no live connection to the SIEM.

## What is coming next

Updated October 3, 2026. The pipeline and investigations below are built; these next milestones have their own validation gates.

| Priority | Work | Status | Evidence to publish |
|---|---|---|---|
| Current | **Private remote access with Tailscale** | Both devices enrolled; narrow policy applied; local IPv4 port checks and post-change SQL load passed; authenticated/off-LAN validation pending | [Policy and local test results](docs/private-access-validation.md), then authenticated admin access, denied unprivileged-device access, and Power BI refresh |
| Next | **One remote Wazuh endpoint** | Planned after private access is validated | A benign event traced from a separate network through Wazuh, SQL and Power BI |
| Following | **More detection validation** | Planned: Atomic Red Team on a separate test VM | Five or more techniques tested, with cases documenting detections and gaps |

The [private-access plan](docs/private-access-plan.md) explains the VPN decision, remaining steps and completion tests. The full [roadmap](ROADMAP.md) also covers phishing analysis, Splunk practice, a short demo video and Suricata. Employers can review the public console and documentation without joining the private lab.

**Next VPN step:** verify authenticated SSH/dashboard access and HTTPS trust, investigate the existing IPv6 dashboard reachability gap, then test from a separate approved off-LAN client and an unprivileged device. The current policy has been reviewed and restricted: local IPv4 SSH/dashboard checks pass, direct API/indexer access fails, and the restricted loader still imports new alerts. Device enrollment is complete; the overall private-access security milestone remains in progress.

**Reliability update (October 4):** workspace-review fixes now have offline regression coverage for loader failures, late-alert reconciliation, scoped case start dates, publication parsing and agent restart recovery. Individual alerts no longer inherit a historical rule verdict. Live reconciliation timing and Power BI refresh remain pending. See [validation and limits](docs/reliability-validation.md).

## Highlights

- **End-to-end detection pipeline.** Sysmon telemetry from a Windows 11 host flows through a Wazuh agent to a Wazuh manager, indexer and dashboard running in a hardened Ubuntu VM.
- **Real triage, written up.** Eight investigations covering every rule behind a fired ATT&CK technique (including a persistence alert caught overnight by a custom rule), each traced to a root cause with evidence, a verdict and the residual risk of any tuning (including why one technique was deliberately left untuned), plus a controlled password-guessing test detected end to end. See [triage/](triage/).
- **Detection tuning that was tested before deployment.** Two child rules lower proven noise to level 3 without disabling the parent detections. Before going live, they were replayed against 674 stored alerts: every noise event matched and every real installer event still fired.
- **94% of Critical alerts eliminated as noise**, so a genuine Critical stands out. The activity is still recorded, just at the right severity.
- **437 of 447 vulnerability findings resolved, and Critical cut from 99 to 0.** A forgotten Firefox, unopened since December 2025 but still installed with its privileged maintenance service, held all 99 Critical findings (CVSS up to 10.0) and 88% of the total; removing it eliminated every Critical ([write-up](docs/finding-forgotten-browser.md)). Retiring an outdated Python later cleared 30 more.
- **A data warehouse that found what the SIEM dashboard hid.** Aggregating alerts in SQL exposed a flat 36-per-hour stream of level 15 alerts from scheduled automation, which led to the second triage report.
- **Posture and coverage reported from evidence.** The Power BI pages rebuild the vulnerability and CIS "before" numbers from Wazuh's own alerts, and map ATT&CK coverage three ways: techniques with a ready rule (115 of 447 for Windows and Linux), techniques that fired here (38, every one triaged to a verdict), and what is still missing.
- **Change management on a monitored workload.** When a scheduled automation workload moved to a new folder and from Python 3.11 to 3.13, the migration was verified independently, file integrity monitoring was repointed and tested against every real path plus decoys (which caught one rule mistake before deployment), and Python 3.11 was retired only after confirming nothing used it, with a rollback path kept. Retiring it removes its 16 interpreter vulnerability findings.
- **Least-privilege data access.** The loader reads Wazuh through an SSH tunnel with a key restricted to a single port forward (no shell), using a read-only indexer account and TLS verified against the Wazuh root CA. The indexer is never exposed on the network.

## Security design

The generated public configuration is an example, not a deployable copy of this
host: replace `SOC-USER` and `SOC-MACHINE-SID` with your own values before use.
The private deployed configuration is maintained separately. See
[publication safety](docs/publication-safety.md) for the current privacy boundary.

| Control | Implementation |
|---|---|
| Network exposure | Baseline: VM on Hyper-V's NAT Default Switch, no port forwarding; `ufw` denies inbound by default with private-range exceptions for 22, 443 and 1514-1515. The indexer (9200) stays on loopback. Tailscale now permits only the selected Windows admin device to reach the VM on TCP 22/443; local IPv4 checks pass and direct TCP 9200/55000 checks fail. Off-LAN/public-access proof remains pending ([results](docs/private-access-validation.md)). |
| Credentials | Installer-generated admin password rotated. A dedicated read-only indexer account for the loader. Secrets live in a git-ignored `.env` and a private backup outside the repo. |
| Loader access | SSH key limited in `authorized_keys` to `permitopen="127.0.0.1:9200"` with `command="/bin/false"`. Verified that it cannot run commands. |
| Transport | TLS verified against the Wazuh root CA, with hostname checking on. Only Python's strict-mode flag is relaxed, because the installer's CA lacks a keyUsage extension; a wrong-hostname test is still rejected. |
| Recovery | Hyper-V checkpoints at known-good points. |
| Data hygiene | The Power BI file, which embeds alert data, is kept out of Git. |

**In progress: Tailscale private remote access.** The Windows admin host and Ubuntu VM are enrolled and online. The default allow-all grant was replaced with device-scoped TCP 22/443 permissions, and four policy tests were accepted on save. Local IPv4 SSH/dashboard reachability and API/indexer unreachability are verified; the next scheduled SQL load succeeded with new Sysmon alerts. IPv6 SSH works, but dashboard TCP 443 was unreachable both before and after the change. The [validation report](docs/private-access-validation.md) records the evidence and limits. Authenticated logins, off-LAN and unprivileged-device tests, public-access/revocation checks and Power BI refresh remain open. A future live console/API will be private; GitHub Pages will continue to serve the sanitized snapshot.

## Results

| Measure | Before | After |
|---|---|---|

## Roadmap

The full plan, with why each chapter matters and when it counts as done, is in [ROADMAP.md](ROADMAP.md).

- [x] Stages 0-4: lab, Wazuh, Sysmon, agent, first event path
- [x] Stage 7: SQL Server warehouse, scheduled loader and case log (open, assign, close, history)
- [x] Detection tuning with tested custom rules
- [x] Stage 4: controlled test that traces one event through every layer ([docs/event-trace.md](docs/event-trace.md))
- [x] Stage 4b: CIS benchmark baseline and hardening ([docs/cis-baseline.md](docs/cis-baseline.md))
- [x] Stage 8: Power BI pages for posture, MITRE ATT&CK coverage and pipeline health
- [x] Least-privilege reporting role, tested: reads `rpt` views, blocked from raw tables and from any change (SQL Server stays Windows-authentication only, so no SQL passwords exist)
- [x] Stage 4c setup: Windows admin host and Ubuntu VM enrolled; initial local tailnet TCP checks recorded
- [ ] Stage 4c validation: restrict unnecessary API access, verify least-privilege policy and run authenticated, allowed/denied and off-LAN tests
- [ ] One remote endpoint: a benign event traced across networks into Wazuh, SQL and Power BI
- [ ] Alert notifications for level 12 and above
- [x] File Integrity Monitoring with who-did-it attribution on secrets, scheduled automation scripts and autostart locations
- [x] Full event archive with tiered retention at every layer
- [x] Collect Windows Defender logs (first full and offline scans recorded)
- [x] Collect PowerShell script block logs (event 4104, deobfuscated)
- [ ] Attack simulations (Atomic Red Team) with a detection coverage map
- [x] Stage 6 (first part): public read-only console on a scrubbed snapshot of real data
- [ ] Stage 6 (second part): private live API/console, with analysts working cases from it; public console stays on a sanitized snapshot
- [ ] Stage 5: Suricata network telemetry
